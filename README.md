<h1>Encryption Software Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I developed a versatile Python application for encrypting and decrypting text and files using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES3) algorithms. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input any text or select any file for encryption. By employing AES and DES3, the application ensures high levels of security and data protection.

The encryption process converts the input data into an unreadable format, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and secure. The application also includes a decryption feature, allowing users to revert the encrypted data back to its original form when needed.

To further enhance the security and reliability of the encryption, the application incorporates two types of security tests: brute force tests and sensitivity tests. The brute force test evaluates the strength of the encryption by simulating attack attempts, ensuring that the encryption keys are robust and difficult to crack. The sensitivity test examines the impact of small changes in the input data on the encrypted output, highlighting the effectiveness of the algorithms in maintaining data integrity and security.

Through this project, I gained extensive experience in implementing encryption algorithms, managing file operations, and conducting security assessments. The application not only serves as a practical tool for securing sensitive information but also provides valuable insights into the robustness of encryption methods against potential cyber threats.
